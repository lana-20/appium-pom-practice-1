# The Page Object Model in Practice - Part 1

*Now that we understand a bit about how the Page Object Model pattern is supposed to work, let's begin the work of retooling our test code to use it.*

Let's continue our work with the Page Object Model by moving into some practical examples. I want to start out with the echo box test code we worked with earlier, but first I want to make a new directory called pom for Page Object Model to showcase all the changes we are going to make. But I want to start out with the same test file and the same conftest.py, so I'll just copy the suite directory and name the new one pom. I can do that on the terminal:

    cp -R suite pom
